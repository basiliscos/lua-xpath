lua-xpath
=========

*lua-xpath* is a small and simple library that implements xpath capabilities.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/basiliscos/lua-xpath.png)](https://travis-ci.org/basiliscos/lua-xpath.png)


This library depends on LuaExpat.

It seems that the original author of the library abandoned it, so it was moved from archive to github and re-organized a bit to support lua-rocks
